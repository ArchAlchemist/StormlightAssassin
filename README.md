<p>This is a demo project built off of the John Lemon tutorial base.</p>

<p>Custom elements:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Character Models (2 variants)</li>
	<li>Character Animations (6, +variants for enemies, future animations will be more flashy)</li>
	<li>Level buildings/structures</li>
	<li>Animated door</li>
	<li>Window</li>
	<li>Helmets, weapons, cups, chairs, tables, lights</li>
	<li>Health/Stormlight UI</li>
	<li>System for regaining health (getting close to light containing objects)</li>
	<li>Enemy AI controlling movement and animations</li>
	<li>Menus</li>
	<li>Free Look Camera</li>
</ul>

<p>all models and animations were made using blender. (except for non-functional doors and pillars, which came from the John Lemon Tutorial)</p>
<p>SFX, Textures, and other artistic assets I used from previous assignments and tutorials.</p>
<p>The game itself is fairly straightforward and basic.</p>

<p>Controls:</p>
<ul>
	<li>WASD to move (wont update 'forward' direction until pressed again while looking in new direction, just in case you want to look around)</li>
	<li>move cursor to alter perspective</li>
	<li>left mouse click to attack (your sword hurts more than theirs, it's a thematic choice)</li>
	<li>regain health by getting near stormlight containing objects (light objects), this will cause that light to go out</li>
	<li>Doors will open when you are near, if open-able</li>
</ul>

<p>The big shiny guy hurts more than you do, and can take more hits, just fyi</p>

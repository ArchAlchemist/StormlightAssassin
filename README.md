This project was mainly to showcase game design and asset creation, which I found I quite enjoy and would like to get better at, with game design being by far my favorite role.

<<<<<<< HEAD
This build only has some minor changes to the actual final project; so you know what I am realistically capable of producing in the time that was given.
I have fixed all bugs that I was able to reproduce so far, but I appreciate continued bug reports.
=======
<p>I followed the tutorial found on the Unity website here: https://learn.unity.com/project/john-lemon-s-haunted-jaunt-3d-beginner</p>
<p>The verbose instructions were just what I needed to get reacquainted with Unity and C# after not having used either for so long.</p>
<p>Download "John Lemon's Haunted Jaunt.zip" to extract all the necessary files to play "John Lemon's Haunted Jaunt.exe" and enjoy the final product of a very well made tutorial!</p>

custom elements:
	Character Models (2 variants)
	Character Animations (6, +variants for enemies, future animations will be more flashy)
	Level buildings/structures
	Animated door
	Window
	Helmets, weapons, cups, chairs, tables, lights
	Health/Stormlight UI
	System for regaining health (getting close to light containing objects)
	Enemy AI controlling movement and animations
	Menus
	Free Look Camera

all models and animations were made using blender. (except for non-functional doors and pillars, which came from the John Lemon Tutorial)

SFX, Textures, and other artistic assets I used from previous assignments and tutorials.

The game itself is fairly straightforward and basic.

Controls
	WASD to move (wont update 'forward' direction until pressed again while looking in new direction, just in case you want to look around)
	move cursor to alter perspective
	left mouse click to attack (your sword hurts more than theirs, it's a thematic choice)
	regain health by getting near stormlight containing objects (light objects), this will cause that light to go out
	Doors will open when you are near, if open-able

The big shiny guy hurts more than you do, and can take more hits, just fyi

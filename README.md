This is a demo project built off of the John Lemon tutorial base.

custom elements:
	Character Models (2 variants)
	Character Animations (6, +variants for enemies, future animations will be more flashy)
	Level buildings/structures
	Animated door
	Window
	Helmets, weapons, cups, chairs, tables, lights
	Health/Stormlight UI
	System for regaining health (getting close to light containing objects)
	Enemy AI controlling movement and animations
	Menus
	Free Look Camera

all models and animations were made using blender. (except for non-functional doors and pillars, which came from the John Lemon Tutorial)

SFX, Textures, and other artistic assets I used from previous assignments and tutorials.

The game itself is fairly straightforward and basic.

Controls
	WASD to move (wont update 'forward' direction until pressed again while looking in new direction, just in case you want to look around)
	move cursor to alter perspective
	left mouse click to attack (your sword hurts more than theirs, it's a thematic choice)
	regain health by getting near stormlight containing objects (light objects), this will cause that light to go out
	Doors will open when you are near, if open-able

The big shiny guy hurts more than you do, and can take more hits, just fyi

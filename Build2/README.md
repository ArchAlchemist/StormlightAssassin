For this final I focused more on asset building and had some technical issues with unity before being able to turn it in.

Here it is though!

Things I added:
	Character Models (2)
	Character Animations (6, variants for enemies)
	Level buildings/structures
	Animated door
	Window
	Helmets, weapons, cups, chairs, tables, lights
	Health bar UI
	System for regaining health (getting close to light containing objects)
	Menu

all models and animations were made using blender.

SFX, Textures, and other artistic assets I used from previous assignments and tutorials.
Some Texturing issues remain, as do some collision issues that have been the main source of my technical difficulties

It's fairly straightforward and basic, but I hope it is enjoyable.
